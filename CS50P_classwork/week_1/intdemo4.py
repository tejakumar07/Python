This code is Writeen in 14 April in 2024 @ 9:57
Last program we fixed the bug that is in intdemo3.py
In last program we introduced a new variable called 'z'
actually when we are creating the new variable and using it and never using again
It will lead to memory waste 
let's fix this in this program
"""
x = int(input("What's X?"))#Here first it take the Input value ant convert into int

y = int(input("What's Y?"))

print(x+y)
