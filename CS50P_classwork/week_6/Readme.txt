This week is about Unit Tests

If one had a habit of testing of code we cannot write the unit test for every code as we written in test_calculator2.py
We can use the 3rd party tools like pytest as third party tool
We can test our code by using pytest it automatically check for unit testing

Unit is a just formal way of describing testing individual unit of program there are typically functions
